*Hello everone, my name is Aditya and I will discuss and describe some of the most important and daily used git commands.*
## Basic Git Commands

The *git init* command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. Itâ€™s the first step to start tracking a project with Git.

```bash
git init
```
 The *git clone* command allows you to copy a remote repository to your local machine, making it easy to contribute or work on existing projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
The *git add* command stages changes to be committed. You can add specific files, or use a dot (<code>.</code>) to add all modified files.

```bash
# Add specific file
git add filename
```

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .
```
The *git commit* command saves your changes in the repository with a descriptive message, making it easier to understand the history of your project.

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Working with Branches

The *git branch* command lists all existing branches or creates a new one. Branches are a powerful way to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

```bash
# List all branches
git branch
```

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch
```

## The *git checkout* command switches between branches. You can use it to switch to an existing branch or create and switch to a new one.

```bash
# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout feature-branch
```
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```

The *git merge* command integrates changes from one branch into another. It's often used to bring a feature branch into the main branch.

```bash
git checkout main
```
```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

## Intermediate Git Commands

The *git pull* command fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch. It's a combination of *git fetch* and *git merge*.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

The *git push* command uploads your local changes to the remote repository. You can push a specific branch or all branches.

```bash
# Push current branch to origin
git push origin main
```

 The *git rebase* command re-applies commits on top of another base branch, providing a cleaner project history compared to merging.</p>

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```
```bash
git rebase main
```

## Conclusion 

Understanding these Git commands will help you manage your code more effectively and collaborate with your team more efficiently. Remember that practice is key when it comes to mastering Git. Explore and use these commands regularly to become more proficient.
